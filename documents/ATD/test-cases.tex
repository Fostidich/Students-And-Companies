\chapter{Test cases}

\section{Testing}
This section outlines the test procedures we conducted to evaluate both the functionality and adherence to the
project product's functions, as outlined in the RASD.
Each test case was designed to include the most relevant usage scenarios from the user's point of view.
Below is a complete list of the test cases performed to validate product performance and compliance.
For each one, the objective, the steps performed, the cases considered and the results obtained are indicated.

                Later, it caused critical errors, such as the student being unexpectedly switched into a company profile
                previously accessed, or the application crashing when clicking on the "Recommendations" section.
        \end{itemize}
        \item The feature to save internships to "Favorites" has not been implemented.

\section{Further notes}
We would have suggested that the development team considered creating a website instead of an Android-only app, as it might
have been more practical to implement.
Additionally, we noticed some issues with the app’s functionalities, for example, clicking the ‘Recommendation’ button causes
it to crash, and the company is only able to download a dummy document instead of the actual CV uploaded by the student.
Moreover, the prototype we received does not appear to fully align with the project specifications, and its usability could be improved.
